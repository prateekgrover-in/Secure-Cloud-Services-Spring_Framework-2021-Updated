1. Introduction (3:06) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov4jGPYWp5U&list=PLyUlngzGzkztgTizxM6_zqiw8sRj7vBm0&index=1)

- Estimates that Amazon has 150,000-450,000 Servers that back their infrastructure to support the services that Amazon Supports, similar statistics are obtained with other large companies and also promising startups. 
- What are the special issues that we face when dealing with utilizing Cloud Services?
- Building promising services that can take data from a single input device, send it to cloud, process it and store it.
- The cloud shall have significantly large resources than a single input device and will be able to achieve amazing results when connected a server of 100,000 devices.
- To understand how to build scalable and secure services that can interact with our mobile phones using HTTP Protocol, Spring Framework and OAuth 2.


2. What are Communication Protocols? (4:14) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3W9gDNZehA&list=PLyUlngzGzkztgTizxM6_zqiw8sRj7vBm0&index=2)

- Important to have a robust protocol to interact securely reliably with the resources.
- Example of importance of communication with Mars Rover, about how it would take 2-3 hours to process a message and let it reach the rover.
- Protocol defines how to communicate with a particular entity, it defines syntax, semantics (meaning behind messages) and spells out the timing between messages. 


3. Intro to HTTP (5:17) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMf7IX1vu9U&list=PLyUlngzGzkztgTizxM6_zqiw8sRj7vBm0&index=3)

- HTTP can be defined as a language or an application protocol to communicate between mobile devices and resources.
- Its the way browser communicates with a web server to retrieve and give resources, browsers generates thousands of requests when interacting with a website.
- It is a Client-Server Protocol, A client sends a request to the server, which in turn spends responses in how it was or was not able to process the response.
- Mobile Device or a Browser, or an IoT Device use HTTP to communicate with the server.
- Widely used protocol, as almost all the websites on the internet use HTTP, organizations naturally want to utilize this benefit.


4. Why HTTP? (4:11) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDFM4dYjT8g&list=PLyUlngzGzkztgTizxM6_zqiw8sRj7vBm0&index=4)

- Request obtained by a browser or a mobile device seems exactly the same to a server, HTTP provides a common interface to communicate with any other client.
- Concept of Sessions (remembering Clients and their data), Data Marshalling (converting requests into formats that can be processed), Infrastructure (Load Balancing Techniques), significant investment has been developed in HTTP, thus it is natural to use HTTP as an interface between the client and server.
- However, some things like an email received can be difficult to fit into an HTTP Model.
